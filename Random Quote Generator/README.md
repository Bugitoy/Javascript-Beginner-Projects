Let's break down the JavaScript code:

Array of Quotes:

The quotes array contains several strings, each representing a quote. Each quote is a combination of the actual quote and the author's name.

generateQuote Function:

The generateQuote function is called when the "Generate Quote" button is clicked (onclick="generateQuote()").

Inside the function:

- quotes.length is an expression that retrieves the number of elements in the quotes array. 

The function generates a random index (randomIndex) within the range of the quotes array length using Math.random() and Math.floor().
Retrieves the quote-text element from the HTML using document.getElementById("quote-text").
Sets the textContent of the quote-text element to the randomly selected quote from the quotes array.
In summary, when the "Generate Quote" button is clicked, the generateQuote function is invoked. This function selects a random quote from the quotes array and displays it in the designated paragraph element on the webpage. The result is a simple random quote generator.
